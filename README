== Welcome to the Devise Rails (3.0.9) Rating template application.

Just a simple demo application with authentication, and an integer rating with a description, as an example.

Devise provides Authentication ( more information at: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#readme )

June 23rd 2010-TODO-Add user to rating, to illustrate how to tie the User and Rating model together.
June 23rd 2010-TODO-Add basic roles - not sure what to use for Role yet; presume there's something with Devise already.
